{-
 - RSA model for scalar implicature, with lexical uncertainty and null-message
 - costs (and an idle but fiddle-with-able temperature parameter).
 -
 - The model defined below is intended to be equivalent to that of Potts et
 - al. 2015[^1] (specifically, the extended model in their Appendix A, of
 - which the model in the main text is a special case).
 -
 - Running `disp_s 1` reproduces table s_1 in the left-most column of their
 - Figure 2 (page 773), and running `disp_L 1` reproduces table L at the top
 - of their Figure 2 (modulo rounding).
 -
 - To do: Think about more principled and/or general approaches to `modify`,
 - `weightedEq`; look at local implicature generation; think about how to
 - automatically generate refined lexica; play with exceptional implicature.
