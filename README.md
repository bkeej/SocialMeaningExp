Some tools for probabilistic calculating and linguistic applications.

Super preliminary for now --- at the moment, these are more learning tools for
me than scientific tools for you. Maybe that will change soon! Some things
I'll be adding in the near future

-   Costs and temperatures (may require `listen` and `tell` like
    functionality, making the underlying monadic structures even more
    `Writer`-y).

-   Variable lexica/lexical uncertainty, a la [Potts et al (2015)][1].

-   Seeing whether there's any abstraction underlying the various RSA models
    (or other kinds of formal pragmatic models, e.g., IBR).

-   Extending to the [scalar implicatures of exceptionally scoping
    indefinites][2]. I think the lexical uncertainty models may work nicely
    here, but I'll need to check.
