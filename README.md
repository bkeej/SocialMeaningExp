Hard fork of the beautiful prob-tools package of Simon Charlow and Dylan Bumford ([here][4]). They implement probability monads detailed by [Erwig & Kollmansberger (2006)][1] and expanded on by Eric Kidd ([here][2], [here][3], and [here][4]), and then provide a few linguistic experiments / explorations.

The reasoning behind the hard fork is I have no intention of submitting pull requests for these experiments, aka my bullshit.

The current additions here include:

	* RSAsoc.hs which implements Social Meaning Games for dogwhistles ([Burnett 2018][6] and [Henderson & McCready 2018][5])
